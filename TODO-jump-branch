1. fix bug where mini buffer is open and you try to use a drop down menu

STATE:

we've made the model keep track of the focused element
but this means the browser's idea of focus and the model's idea of what has focus can be out of sync.
This can lead to a race condition where pressing (alt-h 4) quickly will not jump to hole 4.
This can be fixed in one of three ways:
a. Move all of the state into the model, don't have different keypress handlers for minibuffer & cell.
b. Try to keep state in sync somehow.
c. Move more focus state into the browser dom & keep less in model.

2. maybe something other than alt-h? (brings up help menu on linux/windows)
